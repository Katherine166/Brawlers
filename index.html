        <h2>Best Brawlers for Gem Grab</h2>
        <p>Gem Grab is all about teamwork, holding control of the gems, and ensuring your team’s success. The key to excelling in this mode is having brawlers that can deal damage, protect the gems, and control the map.</p>

        <h3>Top Brawlers for Gem Grab</h3>
        <p>For Gem Grab, brawlers like Jessie, Brock, Pam, and Poco are some of the best choices.

Pam offers both offense and defense with her healing ability and high damage, making her perfect for holding the gem mine. Poco’s healing power can keep teammates alive during intense battles, which is essential for keeping control over the gems.</p>

        <h3>Why These Brawlers Shine</h3>

    <h3>Top Brawlers for Siege</h3>
    <p><strong>Barley</strong>, <strong>Tick</strong>, and <strong>Sandy</strong> are the best options in Siege.

    <h3>Top Brawlers for Hot Zone</h3>
    <p><strong>Frank</strong>, <strong>Tara</strong>, and <strong>Sprout</strong> are top-tier brawlers for Hot Zone.

Sprout’s ability to block off zones with his walls and control the space makes him a perfect choice for this mode.</p>

    <h3>Why These Brawlers Stand Out</h3>
